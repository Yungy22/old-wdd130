        <article>
          <p>Welcome to Quack Rafting Co., where our motto is ‘Just Keep Quacking!’ We started as a humble rafting company, founded by a group of ducks who decided they’d had enough of the pond life.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Founded by a group of ducks who were tired of paddling around the pond, Quack Rafting Co. quickly became the go-to for thrilling river adventures. Their secret? They realized humans had more fun when they didn’t have to paddle with their feet. Today, they’re known for their signature rubber duck life vests and the occasional quacking guide leading the way down the river.</p>
